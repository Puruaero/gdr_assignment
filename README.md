Assignment

I have attached the notebooks where everything is made. The Inference Notebook can be used directly for inference. 

There are 3 notebooks in total
1. Preprocessing_WordEmbedding_DataCreation : This is to preprocess and create training data and also build word embedding model
2. Training : To Train model
3. Inference: To Infer


The model construction details can be seen in Training notebook. I have used 1 LSTM , 1 CNN followed by maxpooling which is followed by a dense layer of size 
8 units. The sigmoid value of each node is scaled by 8. I have used mse loss for training. 

I have noted down the answers to the other questions with me.
